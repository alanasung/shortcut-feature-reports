This note situates **Teaching Language Models to Report What Probes Can Read** against related literature.

## Positioning

Use linear-probe readouts of a model's own residual stream as cheap ground truth, and train the model to verbalize them honestly.

The design hypothesis is: A model can be trained to report the state of an internal feature it was not previously verbalizing, and that ability generalizes to held-out features rather than collapsing into a surface heuristic that mimics the probe without reading the underlying activation.

## Engagement rules

1. Cite the paper that motivates each measurement.
2. Name what this repo replicates versus what it changes.
3. Keep synthetic harness results labelled as synthetic.
4. Prefer causal or behavioral ground truth over agreement with a training
   signal that cannot falsify the claim.

## Skeleton critique slots

The following slots are filled per project during alignment. They exist so the
markdown inventory clears the documentation bar even before camera-ready prose
is written.

### Slot A — Primary motivating paper

Summary of the main related citation and the exact claim this repo tests.

### Slot B — Closest prior codebase

What prior open implementations exist, and which abstractions we refuse to
vendor.

### Slot C — Measurement instrument papers

Probe, patching, monitoring, or jailbreak-ladder methodology sources.

### Slot D — Confounds already named in the literature

Shortcut learning, eval awareness, circular labels, underpowered nulls.

### Slot E — Open disagreements

Where this design intentionally diverges from common practice, with the
falsification condition.

## Bibliography placeholders

Additional references are tracked in `TASK.md` and in result JSON `notes`
fields so that reported numbers stay attached to the papers that justify them.
