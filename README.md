## Overview

This repository implements the pilot and full experimental profiles for
**Probe-Grounded Introspection Training**. The shared engineering spine (config, caching, hooks, metrics,
ablations, reporting, CI) is generated from a single template so all SPAR Fall
2026 repos stay aligned on reproducibility.

Hypothesis (one line): A model can be trained to report the state of an internal feature it was not previously verbalizing, and that ability generalizes to held-out features rather than collapsing into a surface heuristic that mimics the probe without reading the underlying activation.

Mentors: Belinda Li (Anthropic).

## Motivation

Interpretability and safety claims fail in practice for boring engineering
reasons: unpinned weights, chat templates skipped, invalid layer indices,
intervals that span zero treated as nulls, and stages that raise
`NotImplementedError`. This repo treats those as first-class bugs.

## Architecture / Pipeline

flowchart LR
  cfg[Hydra config] --> seed[set_seed]
  seed --> data[build dataset]
  data --> model[load pinned model]
  model --> stages[experiment stages]
  stages --> cache[artifact cache]
  stages --> eval[evaluation harness]
  eval --> agg[aggregate]
  agg --> tables[MD + LaTeX tables]
  agg --> figs[PDF/SVG/PNG figures]
```

| Stage | Module | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Compose config | `configs/` + `introspect.configs` | resolved `config.yaml` |
| Build data | `introspect.data` | splits + manifest |
| Load model | `introspect.models` | `LoadedModel` + resolved commit |
| Run stages | `scripts/run_experiment.py` | per-stage JSON |
| Aggregate | `introspect.reporting` | `results.json` + tables + figures |

## Results

| Experiment | Metric | Value | Provenance |
|---|---|---:|---|
| smoke | config compose | pass | unit / CI |
| pilot | harness recovery | pending | labelled synthetic until measured |

**Provenance.** No measured number in this table comes from a full model run on
private data. Synthetic harness-validation outputs are labelled
`is_synthetic: true` and must not be reported as empirical results.

## Status

Shared spine is in place. Domain-specific stages land behind the experiment
registry and must pass the harness-validation script before any measured claim.

## Design constraints (short)

1. Library code has zero `print`, zero `argparse`, zero `__main__`.
2. Every result JSON carries `task`, `seed`, `git_sha`, `n`.
3. Model revisions are pinned; load path records the resolved commit.
4. Chat templates are applied when available; the path is recorded.
5. MPS sets `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK` and records the flag.
6. CI spanning zero is inconclusive; report MDE and run TOST before null claims.
7. Pilot `n_items >= 512`.
8. Layer indices are validated against `n_layers`.

## Hardware note

Torch model forward passes may use MPS on Apple Silicon. Sklearn, numpy,
pandas, and matplotlib figure generation run on CPU (see `docs/HARDWARE.md`).

## Config composition

```bash
python scripts/run_config_smoke_test.py experiment=pilot model=gpt2 seed=7
python scripts/run_experiment.py experiment=baseline eval.layers=[2,4,6]
```

## Ablations

Ablations live under `src/introspect/ablation/` and return structured dicts. Presets
mirror them under `configs/experiment/ablation_*.yaml`.

## Reporting

```bash
python scripts/aggregate_results.py
python scripts/make_tables.py
python scripts/make_figures.py
```

One aggregation command regenerates Markdown and booktabs LaTeX from raw JSONs.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Open work goes in `TASK.md` / GitHub issues — never as
`TODO` comments in library code.
